# IPL-Score-Prediction
This model attempts to predict the first inning score of an IPL match.


In a cricket match, we often see the prediction line showing the probability of the team winning based on the current match situation. We all have often saw score line showing the projected score of the innings too.Inspired from that and to explore the importance and possibilities of implementation of statistics or in particular, Machine Learning (ML) in Sports I attempted to predict the first inning score of an IPL match. 

The approach over here is to create a Machine learning model which predicts the IPL score when some information is provided as the input. Since, it is a prediction problem we used Regression- which is a Supervised Learning technique in ML. So, the basic requirements for building the ML model are selection of dataset, cleaning it, training of that cleaned dataset using the different algorithms and testing the trained model. For conducting our research, we collected data on all the IPL matches played from 2008-2017 from an open source named Kaggle.


The Dataset contains ball by ball information of the matches played between IPL Teams of Season 1 to 10, i.e. from 2008 to 2017. This Machine Learning model adapts a Regression Appoach to predict the score of the First Inning of an IPL Match.
