# IPL-Score-Prediction
This model attempts to predict the first inning score of an IPL match.


In a cricket match, we often see the prediction line showing the probability of the team winning based on the current match situation. We all have often saw score line showing the projected score of the innings too.Inspired from that and to explore the importance and possibilities of implementation of statistics or in particular, Machine Learning (ML) in Sports I attempted to predict the first inning score of an IPL match. 

The aim of this project is to develop a machine learning model that can predict the first inning score of an IPL match. To achieve this goal, we have used a Regression approach, which is a Supervised Learning technique in Machine Learning. The dataset used in this project contains ball by ball information of the matches played between IPL Teams of Season 1 to 10, i.e. from 2008 to 2017. The best model achieved in this project is Random Forest with an R2 score of 93%.
